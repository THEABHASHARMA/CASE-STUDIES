# ðŸ“Š Business Case Studies Using Statistical Concepts
This repository contains a collection of business case studies that I practiced while learning various statistical concepts. Each notebook is an application of different statistical techniques on real-world or simulated data, helping to reinforce my understanding of how these methods can be applied to solve practical business problems.

# ðŸ“‚ Case Studies

CLT_Application.ipynb

Description: Application of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on height data from different samples, demonstrating how sampling distributions approach normality.
Casino_Case_Study.ipynb

Description: Empirical vs. theoretical approaches tested on casino-related data, illustrating statistical tests like hypothesis testing and probabilities.
Distribution_functions.ipynb

Description: Analysis of height data using distribution functions to explore and visualize various statistical distributions.
Feature_Engineering.ipynb

Description: A notebook focused on feature engineering techniques, which are essential for building accurate models from business data.
Kerala_Flood_Case_Study_Cond_Prob.ipynb

Description: Conditional probability practice using data from the Kerala flood case study, showcasing how probabilities shift with given conditions.
Log_Normal_Distribution.ipynb

Description: Exploration of the log-normal distribution, particularly in its application to business-related data that often follows this pattern.
Match_IQR_Case_Study.ipynb

Description: Case study centered on the interquartile range (IQR), providing insights into data spread and detecting outliers.
Sachin_Case_Study.ipynb

Description: Statistical analysis applied to Sachin Tendulkarâ€™s cricket performance data, demonstrating hypothesis testing, regression, and distribution fitting.
