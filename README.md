# ðŸ“Š Application of Statistical Concepts
This repository contains a collection of business case studies that I practiced while learning various statistical concepts. Each notebook is an application of different statistical techniques on real-world or simulated data, helping to reinforce my understanding of how these methods can be applied to solve practical business problems.
